# Lesson 2

## The adjective **있다**

### Meaning 1: To Have

**... (A은/는) ... X이/가 ... 있다** -> A has X.

### Meaning 2: Being at a location

**~에** is a particle to indicate a location or time and can be used with **있다**.

**... (A은/는) ... X에 ... 있다** -> A is at X.

This can be combined with the following position words:

**안** = inside
**위** = on top
**밑** = below
**옆** = beside
**뒤** = behind
**앞** = in front

**안 is implied when only using ~에.**

Demonstrated with the example of 위:

**... (A은/는) ... X 위에 ... 있다** -> A is on top of X.

Note, that there is now a **space between X** and the **~에 is attached to our position word**.

## The alternative subject marker **~이/가**

Instead of **~은/는** one can use **~이/가**. The still do the same thing. Their difference is subtle.

**~은/는** has a sense of the subject being implicitly compared to something else.

**~이/가** does not have the feeling of an implied comparison.
