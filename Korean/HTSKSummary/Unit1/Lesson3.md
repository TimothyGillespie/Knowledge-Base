# Lesson 3

## Noun Form of **~하다** Verbs / Adjectives

When you have a verb/adjective that ends in ~하다 you **usually** can **remove the ~하다 to receive a respective noun**.

Example:

**행복하다** - To be happy
**행복** - happiness

## Some verbs and all adjectives are intransitive

Some verbs such as (자다) "to sleep" do not make sense to attach an object to. For example, "I sleep you" does not make sense. So having a 을/를 in a sentence with 자다 cannot make sense either. This property is called **intransitivity**.

Adjectives are always intransitive.

## Possessive Particle ~의

When you encounter the **~의 particle as possessive pronounce it as 에**. Beware, it is pronounced differently in other context.

You can combine two nouns with ~의 like this:

**A의 X** - A's X (note that it may be irregular in English with I -> my)

Word that refer to **my/our/their/his/her** are often omitted in Korean.

## 좋다 vs 좋아하다

The word **좋다** is an **adjective** that means "**good**".
The word **좋아하다** is a transitive verb meaning "**to like**".

Respectively, 좋다 can **not** take an object, while 좋아하다 can.

좋아하다 is an example of an exception in ~하다 verb, were removing 하다 does **not** yield a respective noun.

## The word 우리 / 저희 (we / us)

우리 / 저희 works similar to 나 and 저, but refers to first person plural.

**우리 - informal**
**저희 - formal**

However, it is acceptable to use **우리** in formal speech as well, unlike 나.
