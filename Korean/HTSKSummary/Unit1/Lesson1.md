# Lesson 1

## Word Order

Korean Sentences Structure is different from English.

**Subject - Object - Verb**

or

**Subject - Adjective**

Every Korean sentence must end in one of these:

– A verb
– An adjective, or
– 이다

이다 is neither a verb or adjective, but it does behave like them.

Verbs and adjectives in dictionary form end with 다.

## The Word "I"

나 - Used in impolite speech
저 - Used in polite and formal speech

## Particles

Particles are fragments that are attached to words to signify various meanings.

**~는/은** - marks the **subject** of the sentence
**~를/을** - markes the **object** of the sentence

## 이다

**이다** means "**to be**". However, it is not used for adjectives such as "I am **pretty**". It is used for saying that a subject is an object, such as in "This person is a man".

It is always attached to the noun . It is **conjugated** the following way:

**polite**

X이다 -> X이에요 or X예요

**impolite**

X이다 -> X(이)야

## This, That and another That (이 / 그 / 저)

These are words by themselves that are paired with nouns. They have the following meaning:

**이** - this (something close to the speaker - touching distance)
**그** - that (something from previous sentence / context)
**저** - that (something that can be seen, but is far away)

When paired with the words 것, 곳 or 때 they become one words - so no spaces inbetween them.
