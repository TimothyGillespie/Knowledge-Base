# Lesson 7

## ㅅ Irregular

The ㅅ usually gets removed. For example: 짓 + 어 = 지어

This does not apply to all words of this kind. Example:

벗 + 어 = 벗어

## ㄷ irregular

The ㄷ usually gets turned into a ㄹ. Example: 걷 + 어 = 걸어

Also doesn't apply to all:

받 + 아 = 받아

## ㅂ Irregular

ㅂ usually turns into a new sylabyll 우. This is more rarely the case for verbs, more frequent with adjectives.

쉽 + 어 = 쉬 + 우 + 어 = 쉬워

Sometimes, it changes into 오 instead.

돕 + 았어요 = 도 + 오 + 았어요 = 도왔어요

## ㅡ Irregular

When adding ~아/어 to stems ending in ㅡ (e.g., 잠그다), you determine whether to use ~아 or ~어 based on the vowel in the second-to-last syllable, not ㅡ. If the second-to-last vowel is ㅏ or ㅗ, use ~아; otherwise, use ~어. Additionally, the ㅡ in the stem is removed when ~아/어 is added. For example:

잠그다 (ㅏ in 잠) → 잠가

슬프다 (ㅡ in 슬프) → 슬퍼

In cases of one syllabyl words there is nothing to refer to. It becomes ~어.

## 르 Irregular

The 으 gets replaced by ㅏ or ㅓ

다르 + 아요 = 다 + ㄹ + 라요 = 달라요

There are words that work a bit differently.
