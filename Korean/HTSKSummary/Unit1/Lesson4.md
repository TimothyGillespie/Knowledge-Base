# Lesson 4

## Adjectives with ~ㄴ / ~은

Adjectives can only be used with a subject, but no object. But sentences such as "I want a big boat" put the adjective onto the object (big boat). We have a verb (want) that needs to go last as well.

We accomodate this by **attaching ~ㄴ / ~은 to the stem of the adjective**.

big boat -> 큰 베

Note, that this is not a complete sentence.

## The Adjective 많다

There is a lot of X -> X이/가 많다

The usage of ~이/~가 is more natural with 많다 than ~은 / ~는

## Expressing "As well" and "Too" with ~도

To express that something is/does something as well you can attach ~도 to the noun that it applies to. Korean is more specific in that when it comes to English:

1. 나도 케이팝을 좋아헤 - I like kpop, too.
2. 내가 케이팝도 좋아해 - I like kpop, too.

These two sentences mean different things, but we see that in English, it is specified over the entire sentence.

Example one could be expressed a bit more specifically as "I, too, like kpop" to signify that I like it as well just like someone else.
Example two expresses, that I like kpop as well, on top of some other music.
